## Information about the page
1. The webpage is running on **http://localhost:5002/**

2. On this webpage, everybody can watch the chat (blog), However if you want to write a message, you have to **identify yourself**

3. In order to identify yourself: if you have an account you authentify, otherwise you **sign in and then authentify**

4. In order to see the css you have to be **connected to internet**

## Sessions
1. I used some of the work that we had already done during the first homeworks in order to sign up and authentify

2. However, I created a class User in order to create a session. When the session is activated, the user can access the **post page** and **write a post**, otherwise **he can't**

3. The session **activates itself** when the person **authentifies himself**

## Post
1. The posts stored in the **database** are displayed on the main page

2. Everybody can see it

## HTML/CSS
1. On this project I created a **base html** page that I then used for all my pages.
   I never did this before but it is **really helpful**. I will use it again.

2. In order to create a nice css, I used the online ressource of **Bootstrap**

3. I never used bootstrap before but considering the small amount of time that I had, I tried it and it works well

## What I learned
1. During this homework I learned a lot considering my low level

2. I leaned a lot about **how session work**. I never used it before

3. I learned also about **base html pages**

4. I leaned how to **post and display a chat (blog)**
